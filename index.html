                Guide to Tattoo Aftercare
            </h1>
            <p>
                By following these simple steps, you‚Äôll ensure that your tattoo heals properly,
                preserving its beauty and vibrancy for years to come.
                Remember, a well-cared-for tattoo is a long-lasting work of art ü§ç
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Avoid alcohol for the first 48 hours ü•É</h4>
                    <p>
                        It‚Äôs important not to consume alcohol during the first 48
                        hours after getting your tattoo, as it can interfere with
                        the healing process.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Remove the healing bandage on the 5th day ü©π</h4>
                    <p>
                        Keep your tattoo covered with the healing bandage
                        (such as Second Skin) for the first five days.
                        After this time, carefully remove it to allow the skin
                        to breathe and continue healing naturally.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4> Refrain from exercising for the first week üèãüèΩ</h4>
                    <p>
                        Avoid intense physical activities, such as sports or gym
                        workouts, for at least the first week after getting your
                        tattoo. Sweat and friction can irritate the fresh tattoo
                        and increase the risk of infection. Additionally,
                        stretching the skin too much may lead to complications in
                        the healing process or distort the design.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Keep it clean ü´ß</h4>
                    <p>
                        After removing the healing bandage, gently wash the area
                        with mild, unscented soap and lukewarm water.
                        Pat it dry using a clean towel or paper towel.
                        Always wash your hands before touching the tattoo to
                        avoid infection.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Apply ointment üß¥</h4>
                    <p>
                        Apply a thin layer of ointment, such as Aquaphor or Bepanthen,
                        or a specialized tattoo aftercare product. Do this 2-3 times
                        a day for the first week. Avoid using petroleum jelly or
                        other thick ointments, as they can clog pores and slow the
                        healing process.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Moisturize üíß</h4>
                    <p>
                        After the first week, switch to a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic
                        lotion. Apply it 2-3 times a day to keep the tattoo moisturized,
                        but not overly saturated.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Avoid soaking üõÅ</h4>
                    <p>
                        Do not submerge your tattoo in water for extended periods.
                        Avoid swimming pools, hot tubs, baths, and long showers until
                        the tattoo is fully healed, which usually takes 2-4 weeks.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Protect from the sun ‚òÄÔ∏è</h4>
                    <p>
                        Keep your tattoo out of direct sunlight during the healing process.
                        After it‚Äôs fully healed, apply sunscreen with at least SPF 30 to
                        protect the colors and prevent fading.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Don‚Äôt scratch or pick üìå</h4>
                    <p>
                        Resist the urge to scratch or pick at your tattoo as it heals.
                        This can cause scarring, infection, or color loss. If the itching
                        becomes unbearable, gently pat or slap the area instead.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Allow for natural peelingüß∑</h4>
                    <p>
                        Your tattoo will start to peel after about a week, revealing new skin
                        underneath. This is a normal part of the healing process.
                        Do not forcibly peel off the skin or scabs‚Äîlet it come off naturally.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
